# Spring Boot 3 Backend Project

This is a modern backend project built using Spring Boot 3 and Gradle. It features a robust architecture designed for scalability, security, and reactive data handling. The project incorporates role-based access control and integrates both traditional Spring MVC and reactive Spring WebFlux modules.

## 🚀 Features

- ✅ Role-Based Authentication & Authorization with Spring Security
- ✅ REST API with Spring MVC & Reactive API with Spring WebFlux
- ✅ MongoDB for high-performance NoSQL data storage
- ✅ JPA & Hibernate support for potential relational data management
- ✅ JWT-based security layer
- ✅ Custom Rate Limiting configuration
- ✅ Clean Gradle-based build system

## 🔐 Security

- Role-based access control
- JWT Token generation and validation
- Secured endpoints with fine-grained access control
- Authentication/Authorization filters

## ⚡ Reactive Programming

Reactive modules leverage Spring WebFlux for non-blocking, event-driven data processing. Designed for high-performance environments and efficient resource utilization.

## 🧪 Testing (Optional)

If you're adding tests, this can be extended with:

- JUnit 5
- Mockito
- WebTestClient for reactive endpoint testing

## 🏁 Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git
   cd your-repo-name
   ```

2. Configure MongoDB in application.yml:
   ```yaml
   spring:
     data:
       mongodb:
         uri: mongodb://localhost:27017/your-db
   ```

3. Run the application:
   ```bash
   ./gradlew bootRun
   ```

## 📬 API Documentation

You can integrate Swagger/OpenAPI for interactive API documentation.

## 🧩 Future Improvements

- Add unit and integration tests
- Dockerize the application
- Add Swagger UI for API testing
- Enhance rate-limiting with Redis or Bucket4j
- Implement refresh tokens
